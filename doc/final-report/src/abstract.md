DeepSpeech flexibly integrates different levels of knowledge to decode a word lattice in speech recognition within a word-level CRF model, in an interpretable manner.

DeepSpeech facilitates feature extraction, factor graph generation, and statistical learning and inference. It takes word lattice as input, perform feature extraction specified by developers, generate factor graphs based on descriptive rules, and perform learning and inference automatically. 

DeepSpeech is based on the scalable statistical inference engine DeepDive (http://deepdive.stanford.edu).
