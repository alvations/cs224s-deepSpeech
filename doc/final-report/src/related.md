We are conducting a relevant research in OCR systems. We treat OCR
softwares as black boxes, obtain their output sequences --- essentially
the same as a word lattice, and try to use knowledge to approach and
beat oracle error rate in the lattice.

In an error analysis, we have following interesting observations: 
(1) Most errors generated by OCR systems are automatically solvable 
    with a knowledge taxonomy similar to listed above.
(2) There is no one-fixes-all knowledge in OCR.
(3) The most useful kinds of knowledge are corpus statistics and 
    OCR-software specific knowledge.

With the insight from this relevant project, we propose to make use of
corpus statistics and ASR-software specific knowledge in our ASR system.

We will look into SCARF system and its applications meanwhile for comparison.
