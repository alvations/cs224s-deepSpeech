			Introduction
		</h3>

		
<p> Broadcast News Lattices, Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) catalog number LDC2011T06 
  and isbn 1-58563-578-2, was developed by researchers at Microsoft and Johns 
  Hopkins Unviersity (JHU) for the <a href="http://www.clsp.jhu.edu/workshops/ws10/groups/srscrf/">Johns 
  Hopkins 2010 Summer Workshop on Speech Recognition with Conditional Random Fields</a>. 
  The lattices were generated using the <a href="docs/AttilaSLT11.pdf">IBM 
  Attila speech recognition toolkit</a>  
  and were derived from transcripts of approximately 400 hours of English broadcast 
  news recordings. They are intended to be used for training and decoding with 
  Microsoft's segmental CRF toolkit for speech recogntion, <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/scarf/">SCARF</a>. 
</p>
<p>The goal of the JHU 2010 workshop was to advance the state-of-the-art in core 
  speech recognition by developing new kinds of features for use in a Segmental 
  Conditional Random Field (SCRF). The SCRF approach generalizes Condtional Random 
  Fields to operate at the segment level, rather than at the traditional frame 
  level. Every segment is labeled directly with a word. Features are then extracted 
  which each measure some form of consistency between the underlying audio and 
  the word hypothesis for a segment. These are combined in a log-linear model 
  (lattice) to produce the posterior possibility of a word sequence given the 
  audio. </p>
<h3>
			Data&nbsp;
		</h3>

		
<p>Broadcast News Lattices consists of training and test material, the source 
  data for which was taken from various corpora distributed by LDC. </p>
<p><strong>Training Data</strong> <br>
  <br>
  The training lattices total 152251 and were derived from the following data 
  sets:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC97S44">1996 
  English Broadcast News Speech LDC97S44</a>; <a href="http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC97T22">1996 
  English Broadcast News Transcripts (HUB4) LDC97T22</a> (104 hours)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC98S71">1997 
  English Broadcast News Speech (HUB4) LDC98S71</a>; <a href="http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC98T28">1997 
  English Broadcast News Transcripts (HUB4) LDC98T28</a> (97 hours) 
<p><a href="http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2005S11">TDTD4 
  Multilingual Broadcast News Speech Corpus LDC2005S11</a>; <a href="http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2005T16">TDT4 
  Multilingual Text and Annotations LDC2005T16</a> (300 hours)</p>
<p>The lattices can be related to the original audio files via the file <strong>&quot;train.db.gz&quot;</strong> 
  which lists for each segment a tag-name, segment number, the original audio 
  file, channel (always 0), start time, and end time (in seconds). A sample line 
  is as follows:</p>
<p> 19960510_NPR_ATC#Ailene_Leblanc 0001 19960510_NPR_ATC.sph 0 76.767 89.404 
  | <br>
  <br>
  This sample line corresponds to the release lattice labeled: </p>
<p>19960510_NPR_ATC#Ailene_Leblanc@0001.dc </p>
<p>The file <strong>&quot;train.Bdc&quot;</strong> contains &quot;denominator&quot; 
  lattices. The file <strong>&quot;train.Bnc&quot;</strong> has the &quot;numerator&quot; 
  lattices containing the subset of paths consistent with the training transcriptions. 
  The file <strong>&quot;train.Btr&quot;</strong> consists of the transcriptions. 
  The file <strong>&quot;train.Bbase&quot;</strong> contains the baseline (one-best) 
  word detections from the Attila system. <br>
  <br>
  The lattices were generated from an acoustic model that included LDA+MLLT, VTLN, 
  fMLLR based SAT training, fMMI and mMMI discriminative training, and MLLR. The 
  lattices are annotated with a field indicating the results of a second &quot;confirmatory&quot; 
  decoding made with an independent speech recognizer. When there was a correspondence 
  between a lattice link and the 1-best secondary output, the link was annotated 
  with +1. Silence links are denominated with 0 and all others with -1. Correspondence 
  was computed by finding the midpoint of a lattice link and comparing the link 
  label with that of the word in the secondary decoding at that position. Thus, 
  there are some cases where the same word shifted slightly in time receives a 
  different confirmation score. </p>
<p><strong>Test Data</strong> <br>
  <br>
  The test lattices are derived from the English broadcast news material in <a href="http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2007S10
  ">2003 NIST Rich Transcription Evaluation Data LDC2007S10</a>. <strong>Bbase</strong> 
  and <strong>Bdc</strong> files are provided, along with the<strong> db file 
  rt03.db.gz</strong> to link the segments to times in the original waveform. 
  Scoring scripts may be obtained from the  <a
			href="http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/mig/tests/rt/2003-spring/index.html ">NIST Rich Transcription website</a>.
